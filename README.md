Data-Driven Civil Project Monitoring | Power BI, SQL

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard using DAX, slicers, and field parameters to track project performance across location, weather conditions, project type, and risk level.

Utilized SQL queries (joins, aggregations, data extraction) to prepare structured datasets for seamless dashboard integration.

Delivered actionable insights by highlighting high-risk projects, identifying location-based delays, and assessing weather-related impacts, enabling data-driven decision-making for project stakeholders.
